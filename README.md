## Usage

K3K consists of a controller and a cli tool, the controller can be deployed via a helm chart and the cli can be downloaded from the releases page.

### Deploy Controller

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```sh
  helm repo add k3k https://rancher.github.io/k3k
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
k3k --devel` to see the charts.

To install the k3k chart:

```sh
helm install my-k3k k3k/k3k --devel
```

To uninstall the chart:

```sh
helm delete my-k3k
```

**NOTE: Since k3k is still under development, the chart is marked as a development chart, this means that you need to add the `--devel` flag to install it.**

### Create a new cluster

To create a new cluster you need to install and run the cli or create a cluster object, to install the cli:

#### For linux and macOS

1 - Donwload the binary, linux dowload url:
```
wget https://github.com/rancher/k3k/releases/download/v0.0.0-alpha2/k3kcli
```
macOS dowload url:
```
wget https://github.com/rancher/k3k/releases/download/v0.0.0-alpha2/k3kcli
```
Then copy to local bin
```
chmod +x k3kcli
sudo cp k3kcli /usr/local/bin
```

#### For Windows 

1 - Download the Binary:
Use PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet to download the binary:
```powershel
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/rancher/k3k/releases/download/v0.0.0-alpha2/k3kcli-windows" -OutFile "k3kcli.exe"
```
2 - Copy the Binary to a Directory in PATH:
To allow running the binary from any command prompt, you can copy it to a directory in your system's PATH. For example, copying it to C:\Users\<YourUsername>\bin (create this directory if it doesn't exist):
```
Copy-Item "k3kcli.exe" "C:\bin"
```
3 - Update Environment Variable (PATH):
If you haven't already added `C:\bin` (or your chosen directory) to your PATH, you can do it through PowerShell:
```
setx PATH "C:\bin;%PATH%"
```

To create a new cluster you can use:

```sh
k3k cluster create --name example-cluster --token test
```
